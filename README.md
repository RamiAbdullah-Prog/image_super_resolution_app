# Image Enhancement with Autoencoder Model

This project is a web application built using Flask and TensorFlow that allows users to upload images and enhance them using an autoencoder model. The model improves the quality of the uploaded image and returns the enhanced version.

## Features

- Upload an image to the application.
- Enhance the uploaded image using a pre-trained autoencoder model.
- Download the enhanced image.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Pillow
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-enhancement.git
   cd image-enhancement
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download or train your own autoencoder model, and place it in the root directory of the project with the filename `autoencoder_final.keras`.

## How to Run

1. After setting up the environment, run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## Usage

1. On the home page, you will see a file upload form.
2. Select an image to upload and click "Submit".
3. The image will be sent to the server, where it will be enhanced using the pre-trained autoencoder model.
4. The enhanced image will be returned and available for download.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the following Python packages:

```txt
Flask
tensorflow
numpy
Pillow
```

You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model

This application uses a pre-trained autoencoder model to enhance the quality of uploaded images. The model is loaded from the `autoencoder_final.keras` file, which must be placed in the root directory of the project.

If you don't have a pre-trained model, you can either train your own autoencoder model using TensorFlow or download an existing one.



Make sure to update the `git clone` URL and the `autoencoder_final.keras` model file if necessary. Also, you can customize any sections to fit your specific use case better.
